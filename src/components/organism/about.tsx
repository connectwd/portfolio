          I’m a software developer passionate about building intuitive, high-performing applications that blend clean design with solid engineering. My work focuses on delivering scalable solutions that not only meet user needs but also adhere to best practices for maintainability and performance.
<br /><br />
I’ve had the opportunity to work on large-scale, customer-facing applications that supported millions of daily users and smaller projects within areas such as education and transportation. I’ve also expanded my skill set with a secondment in software testing, gaining experience in automation and CI/CD processes.
