          I’m a software developer passionate about building intuitive, high-performing applications that blend clean design with solid engineering. My work focuses on delivering scalable solutions that not only meet user needs but also adhere to best practices for maintainability and performance.
<br /><br />
Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at STEM Learning, where I develop user-focused features, maintain robust technical standards, and contribute to the evolution of our platform using modern frameworks like Next.js and TypeScript. My role also involves actively supporting Agile workflows to drive collaboration and efficient development cycles.
<br /><br />
In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to work on large-scale, customer-facing applications at William Hill, crafting solutions that supported millions of daily users. I’ve also expanded my skill set with a secondment in software testing, gaining experience in automation and CI/CD processes.
